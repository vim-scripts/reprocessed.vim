A plugin to make it easier to work with the Processing language in vim. It is originally based on https://github.com/sophacles/vim-processing, which was in turn an extension of vim script #2115.

Please note that this plugin has currently only been tested on OS X. I would love to hear from you if you use this plugin (successfully or otherwise) on Windows or Linux.

Features:
* Syntax highlighting
* Documentation lookup
* Run sketches from within vim

For more detailed information, please see the project on GitHub here: https://github.com/willpragnell/vim-reprocessed
